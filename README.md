# Data-Exploration-with-SQL
In this project, i explored covid19 dataset to gain more insights and understanding of the numbers.
I compared various variables such as the infection rates, death rates and percentages between continents and countries to understand the level of resilience worldwide.
I also drilled down by joining tables like the covid_death and the covid_vaccination to give me a global perspective of the death percentages.
